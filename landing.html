        <h3>Aishu</h3>
        <p>There were many instances in my life where I thought that this person might be the one, but none of them made me feel this way. The way I feel when I meet u...when I hug you...when I hold you closely...when I see ur eyes...when I just spend time with you, not worrying about anything else and just being cut of from all the worries. Like that comfort and that love or whatever u may call it, I never felt it towards anyone. And whatever I'm feeling right now is making me do things I never thought I would do, and I'm happy that I'm doing it cuz that is making me reallllyyyy happpyyyy üåö. It is making every day of my life even more memorable. And I just want to continue it being like that. 

        All Im saying is that you make me feeel realllyyy special and whenever I'm with you I'm happyyy and always smiling.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
